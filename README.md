## **_Description_**

### A interface that allows a realtors to input important dates with information that pertains to closings. The app will store all inputs in a database; then display the information on screen in a chronological order and eventually add a method for auto emails to remind them as well as their clients.

## **_How To Get Started_**

### I will begin by building the interface to allow the user to input the information, then store it in the databbase, then display information on screen in another tab.
